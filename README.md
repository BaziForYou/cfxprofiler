## Usage
Place the script directly into your `resources` folder. Ensure it is not in a subfolder, and is named `"KLProfiler"` or it will not work properly. You also need the Ace permission `add_ace resource.KLprofiler command allow`.

If you have any issues, join our [Discord.](https://discord.kahpslock.dev/)
